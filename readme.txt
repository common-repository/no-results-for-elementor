== Installation ==

From your WordPress dashboard

1. Plugins > Add New
2. Search for "No Results For Elementor" and Install
3. Activate from your Plugins page
4. Enable the plugin and modify the settings to fit your needs.
5. Click on 'Save Changes' and you're DONE!

Note - In order for this to work correctly, you need to setup a post results query through Elementor's widgets. For example this can can be a blog posts feed or search results page feed, as long as you are using Elementor's Posts Widget or Archive Posts Widget to output the results.
